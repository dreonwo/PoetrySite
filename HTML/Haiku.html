            <h1>Haiku</h1>

            <p>
                Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry made of short, unrhymed lines that evoke natural imagery.
                Haiku can come in a variety of different formats of short verses, though the most common is 
                a three-line poem with a 5-7-5 syllable pattern. A common structure that most haiku poems 
                follow is the 5-7-5 structure. The first line is 5 syllables, the second line is 7 syllables,
                and the third line is 5 syllables. Nature themes and imagery evoking a specific season are the
                traditional focus of haiku poetry.
