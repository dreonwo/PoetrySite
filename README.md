# PoetrySite
My Poetry website is a website made to highlight the various forms of poetry and educate users on how they are written with given examples. The tools used to create this website include HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My goal in this project was to shed some light on the beauty of poetry and the many ways that beauty could be manifested.
