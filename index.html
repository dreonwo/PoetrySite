                <h2> What is Poetry?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Poetry is a work of literature that uses the sounds and rhythms to
                        evoke deeper significance than the literal meanings of words. Poetry 
                        is art that is not bound to a particular structure and is expressed 
                        in many different ways. Poetry is a written art that pulls on emotion 
                        and is meant to go beyond the words you see. Poetry has been around for 
                        thousands of years and is still very relevant today. Many poets like 
                        Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and Emily Dickinson shaped how poetry 
                        is expressed today. Below are some key terms:
