        <h1>Blank Verse Poems</h1>

        <p>
            Blank Verse poetry has no fixed number of lines. It has a conventional
            meter that is used for verse drama and long narrative poems. It is often
            used in descriptive and reflective poems and dramatic monologues. Blank 
            verse is poetry written with a precise meter—almost always iambic pentameter
            that does not rhyme. Blank verse is poetry written with a precise meter.

                But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,

                Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
