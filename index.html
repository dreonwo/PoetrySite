        <h2> What is Poetry?</h2>
            <p>
                Poetry is a work of literature that uses the sounds and rhythms to
                evoke deeper significance than the literal meanings of words. Poetry 
                is art that is not bound to a particular structure and is expressed 
                in many different ways. Poetry is a written art that pulls on emotion 
                and is meant to go beyond the words you see. Poetry has been around for 
                thousands of years and is still very relevant today. Many poets like 
                Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and Emily Dickinson shaped how poetry 
                is expressed today. Below are some key terms:

                <dd>A weak syllable followed by a strong syllable.</dd>
                <dt>Iambic Pentameter</dt>
                <dd>This phrase is in reference to a type of meter poems can follow.<br>

                <dd>Individual units within a line of poetry that has a specific number of syllables and a specific pattern of emphasis a.k.a Meter.</dd>

        </div>
            <p id = "extraInfo">Rhyme and Meter can be confusing to differentiate between but the<br>
                main difference between the two is that rhyme is solely based on the <br>
                sound of the word like cat and rat where the ending sound for both words <br>
                is the same. While Meter is based on how much emphasis goes into saying a syllable<br>
                of a word, for example in the word control the con part isn't as stressed as the trol part.</p>
